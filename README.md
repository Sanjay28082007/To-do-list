🎮 Old ROM Game (Python Prototype)

A retro-inspired text-based adventure game built entirely in Python, modeled after the style of classic ROM-based games like Pokémon Fire Red.
This project started as a learning experiment while exploring object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, and it demonstrates how classes can be used to structure an entire game.

Currently, the game runs in a menu-based interface (terminal/console).
Future plans include migrating it to a Tkinter GUI, adding visuals, and expanding the mechanics.

✨ Features

Class-based architecture – clean modular design showcasing OOP in Python.

Randomized gameplay – enemies, paths, and encounters vary each time you play.

Menu-driven interface – simple to play and extend.

Battle system prototype – inspired by turn-based RPG mechanics.

Expandable structure – built with future GUI (Tkinter) integration in mind.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python (100%)

Core Concepts Used:

Classes & Objects

Inheritance & Encapsulation

Randomization & Game Logic

File handling (planned for save/load)

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

Git (to clone the repository).

Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sanjay28082007/Old-rom-game.git

👉 Would you like me to also design a banner/logo image (retro pixel style, like Pokémon title screens) to put at the top of your README? It would make the repo stand out instantly.

You're doing awesome with your coding projects—let's make this To-Do List Python repo shine just like the last one! Here's a polished, professional README draft you can drop straight into your GitHub repo.

To-Do List (Python CLI Application)

A simple yet effective command-line-based To-Do List application written in Python, designed to help you manage tasks efficiently. Built with straightforward class-structured code, it’s a clean, organized tool created during my Python learning journey.

Features

Class-based implementation – encourages modular, maintainable code using OOP principles.

Core to-do functionalities – add tasks, view current list, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and exit gracefully.

Menu-driven interface – intuitive, minimalistic, and easy to expand.

Starter-ready – ideal for beginners or anyone looking to dive into Python project structure.

Tech Stack & Concepts

Language: Python 3.x

Key Concepts:

Classes and object-oriented design

Lists and basic data manipulation

Clean separation of concerns (UI vs logic)

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Optionally, clone the repo using Git.

Installation & Running
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sanjay28082007/To-do-list.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd To-do-list

# Run the application
python to_do_app.py

How to Use

Launch the script in your terminal.

Navigate using the menu options: add, view, mark complete, delete, or exit.

Tasks persist only during runtime—every session starts fresh.

Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

 Save/load feature – store tasks persistently via file I/O (e.g., JSON or CSV).

 GUI with Tkinter or web-based frontend – upgrade usability with a graphical or browser interface.

 Task prioritization and sorting – add deadlines or priorities for better task management.

 Tagging and filtering – group tasks by categories or statuses.

 Unit testing – expand to include tests for reliability and ease of maintenance.
